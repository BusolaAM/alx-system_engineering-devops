# This README file is for the 0x08. Networking basics #1 project

In this project, I continued to learn about IP addresses while practicing manipulating them with Bash scripts.

## Project Tasks

```0. Change your home IP```

o   0-change_your_home_IP: Bash script that configures an Ubuntu server as follows:

o   localhost resolves to 127.0.0.2

o   facebook.com resolves to 8.8.8.8

```1. Show attached IPs```

o   1-show_attached_IPs: Bash script that displays all active IPv4 IP's on the machine.

```2. Port listening on localhost```

o   100-port_listening_on_localhost: Bash script that listens on port 98 on localhost.
